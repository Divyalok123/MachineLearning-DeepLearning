## Breast Cancer Classifier

The goal of this project was to classify whether a mass detected in a mammogram is benign or malignant. I tried to use various models to do the same. 

I used Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, KNN, Neural Networks, and Naive Bayes in this project, trying to get the best possible accuracy in all of them by changing the hyperparameters. 

The code is present in **MammogramPrediction.py** file.
